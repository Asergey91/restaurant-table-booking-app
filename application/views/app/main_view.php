          This is a little project partially to increase my chances of getting an interview with a particular employer, partially because it could really help to learn an MVC framework, other than Ruby On Rails =).<br><br>
          This web site is a demo of a simple restaurant reservation app. Below you can view the customer view as well as the admin view. The database are active so you can create records.<br><br>
          This is mostly a coding project so while the GUI is a little barren, most of the work was done on the back-end. There is a lot of code dealing with validation, AJAX requests and model relationships as well as seeding data. If you would like to look at the code please check out the link to github below.<br><br>
          <b>Technologies Used:</b> PHP, CodeIgniter, JS, AJAX, Bootstrap<br><br>
          <b>Methodologies:</b> MVC (kinda...), Material design, Responsive design<br><hr>
